## About Me
I am a full stack Data Scientist and Business Analysis student.

I am finishing up a BS in Business Analytics (ETA 2023).  My
Business Analytics degree encompasses many elements of a 
business administration degree but also focuses primarily on 
analytics for decision making and business intelligence.

I concurrently take many data science related courses on Udemy and
Coursera to gain applied analytics and machine learning experience.  
These courses have enabled me to gain knowledge and hands on 
experience with the technologies needed to model solutions for businesses.


My goal is to hedge my business related education and 
blend it with data science so that I can become a Data Scientist 
who not only understands the technological tools needed for 
businesses to thrive but also understands the inner workings of 
a business.  Knowing what managers need before they ask for it
is a skill I believe is important.  I am confident that blending 
my business education and data science together will prove that 
to be so.
